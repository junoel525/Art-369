            <p>
                Welcome to Sparkle's Squirrel Hunt!
                <br>
                <br>
                This website was made for Sparkle Sunshine, a goldendoodle who is 14 and still has never successfully caught a squirrel. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Sparkle always likes to bark at squirrels, and she's been in close enough proximity before to catch one. But when the time comes, she freezes and lets it run away. This game gives her practice catching squirrels, and it is designed to help Sparkle gain confidence in her squirrel-catching abilities for when she's out in the real-life backyard trying to catch one.
